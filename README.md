# Annals of Uranus website
UNDER CONSTRUCTION; Nick Horowitz's website for his band.

Objective: to be as wacky and chaotic as possible


## How To Install and View Locally

The site is built with Jekyll and styled with Sass, so we'll use the command line to set up and execute these.

1. Clone repo and download files, and enter folder locally through command line.

2. Use Compass to watch for Sass style changes.
    ```
    compass watch
    ```
   Once css/styles.css has been written, exit the task.
  
    ```
    Ctrl+C
    ```
  
3. Execute Jekyll.
    ```
    jekyll serve
    ```

4. View the site locally on http://localhost:4000/.
